|| Advent of Code 2025 - Day 10: Lights Out Switch Solver (Pure Miracula)
||
|| Each line holds a [target] light pattern, then (i,j,...) switches that
|| toggle the listed positions. Find the fewest switch presses producing
|| the target from all-off, summed over every line. Search by iterative
|| deepening on the press count: try every k-subset of the switches for
|| k = 0, 1, 2, ... and stop at the first k that matches.
